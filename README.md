# TechnoHorror RPG 

This monster fighter with RPG elements. The main mechanic is eating different types of monsters in order to evolve yourself into a bigger, badder monster. Your diet is important, as different combinations of monsters will turn you into different things! As the title suggests, the idea for the theme of the game revolves around technological spooky stuff not unlike what you see out of DOOM or H.R. Giger.

You are lowly, basic monster. You are not special. You are infact so devoid of any distinguishing characteristics that you can absorb the traits of other much cooler monsters to grow into a much cooler you. Alright I guess that's kind of special.
