# TechnoHorror RPG 

A monster fighter with RPG and exploration elements. And maybe some base-building. As the title suggests, the idea for the theme of the game revolves around technological spooky stuff not unlike what you see out of DOOM or H.R. Giger.

## Todo List

* Battle System
* Enemy Class Development
* Recruiting System
* Fortress and Party Management Mechanics
* World Map and Exploration
* A bloody title
